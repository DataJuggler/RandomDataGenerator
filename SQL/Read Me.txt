First create a new database in SQL Server Management Studio called RandomData.

Next, extract the Zip file and it becomes a 24 meg SQL Script that inserts the tables and fields for the
RandomData Database.

The dabase contains the following tables and records

1. Address - 0 Records
2. FirstName - 5,163 Records
3. LastName - 6,080 Records
4. Member - 0 Records
5. StreetName - 52,680 Records
6. ZipCode - 74,022 Records

Random Data Generator builds the Member & Address tables.
